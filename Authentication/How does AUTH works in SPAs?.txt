Lifecycle AUTH: 

- SPA sounds AUTH to SERVER (any restful api) to validate (email, password)
- SERVER doesn't send sesison back, because it's usually a restful api or stateless 
- SERVER sends Token back (a javascript object) 
- Object stored in localStorage (not redux, because it can be lost)

- Let's say we send a request to protected resource in server (change passwrod, or create blogpost) 
- Because we constantly don't check session, because there's none; we send a token, which is created by the server 
- Only the token sent by the server is accepted on the server.
