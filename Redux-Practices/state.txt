What is state?

Example:

- Ingredients that you add to a burger. 
- Is an user authenticated? => might determine the options you might show in the menu for example
- Is a modal open? => UI state! It's less about data, it's more about pure UI only state.
- List of blog 

State can be complex: 

- Prop drilling (continuously passing down state) 

For example: 

Place 1: 
1. In dashboard
2. Is user logged in? 

Place 2:
3. In your product cart
4. Is user logged in? 

You would need to connect the state from the Auth under login all the way to 
the product - cart section; that would be extremely difficult.


Redux can be used to pass state down globally without having to prop drill.
